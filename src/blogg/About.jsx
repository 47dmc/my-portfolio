      In this project, I implemented a dynamic web application utilizing CRUD operations <br />
      for seamless data management, including create, read, update, and delete functionalities. <br /> Leveraging npm's json-server, I set up a local API for efficient data handling. <br />
      The application features simple yet captivating UI components, complemented by robust routing <br />
      to enhance user navigation and overall experience.
